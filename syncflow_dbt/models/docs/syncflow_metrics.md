### Activation Logic (PQL Project)

We define a **Product Qualified Lead (PQL)** based on the following three pillars of activation:

1. **Core Activation:** The user creates their first project. This represents the "Aha! moment" where they see the product's value.
2. **Expansion Intent:** The user invites a teammate. In B2B SaaS, multi-user accounts have a **3x higher LTV** than solo accounts.
3. **Ecosystem Integration:** The user connects an external tool (Slack/Github). This creates "product stickiness" and significantly reduces churn probability.
